function [ Match ] = match_wrf2aircraft( Raw, wrf_dirs, wrf_prof_mode )
%MATCH_WRF2AIRCRAFT Generates a structure matching WRF output to aircraft data
%   MATCH = MATCH_WRF2AIRCRAFT( RAW, WRF_DIRS ) Matches the aircraft data
%   contained in RAW to the WRF data in wrfout_* files contained in
%   WRF_DIRS. RAW must be a structure that contains the fields "lon",
%   "lat", "pres", "dvec", and "campaign". "lon" and "lat" are the
%   longitude and latitude of the aircraft data (longitude must be in
%   degrees west is < 0). "pres" is the pressure of the aircraft
%   measurements in hPa. "dvec" is a vector of Matlab date numbers giving
%   the date and time of each aircraft measurement. "campaign" is a string
%   that gives the campaign name (solely for record keeping - does not need
%   to be any specific format). The other fields in RAW must have names
%   that match the names of WRF-Chem variables you want to match with the
%   aircraft data. For example, if you want to compare aircraft NO, NO2,
%   and HNO3 data with WRF files that contain that data as variables no,
%   no2, and hno3, RAW should have the aircraft data stored in fields no,
%   no2, and hno3, respectively. WRF_DIRS must be a string giving single
%   directory where all necessary WRF data can be found, or a cell array of
%   those directories.
%
%   MATCH = MATCH_WRF2AIRCRAFT( RAW, WRF_DIRS, 'monthly' ) tells this
%   function to look for monthly averaged WRF files (following the naming
%   convention WRF_BEHR_monthly_XX.nc) instead of time resolved output
%   files, where XX is the 2-digit month number.
%
%   MATCH = MATCH_WRF2AIRCRAFT( RAW, WRF_DIRS, 'v2' ) tells this to use
%   BEHR v2 NO2 profiles that are stored in .mat files with names
%   mXX_NO2_profile.mat Note that these files only contain NO2 data.
%
%   The output structure has three primary fields: "data", "wrf", and
%   "indicies". It is constructed such that all the subfields in "data" and
%   most of the subfields in "wrf" are just vectors. In "data", the fields
%   are just a concatenation in time of fields from the aircraft data for
%   the campaign. In "wrf", the vector fields are just the WRF data that
%   corresponds to the aircraft measurement; a whole series of aircraft
%   measurements that falls in the same grid cell will correspond to the
%   same WRF value.
%
%   The "indicies" field allows you to map the data in the previous two
%   fields to the WRF grid. The subfields give the index in the
%   corresponding WRF dimension. The WRF xlon and xlat fields are provided
%   as arrays, the WRF pressure for each grid cell is provided as a vector,
%   the bottom_top index should just be taken as-is, that is a model layer
%   index.
%
%   The "time" index bears mention; since a large number of WRF files do
%   not have any corresponding aircraft data, they are skipped entirely.
%   The "datevec" subfield under "wrf" has the times of the files that had
%   corresponding aircraft data, the time index is the index in this
%   vector.

% History: 
%   27 Oct 2017 - modified to (a) split out the matching code from the code
%   that loads the aircraft data and (b) to let it read monthly and BEHR
%   version 2 NO2 profiles. Verified that old functionality didn't change
%   by running it with match_wrf2campaigns.dc3 using wrf_dirs =
%   '/Volumes/share2/USERS/LaughnerJ/WRF/DC3/lnox_off-fixed_BCs' and
%   comparing vs. '/Users/Josh/Documents/MATLAB/BEHR/Workspaces/WRF/Chem 
%   Comparison/DC3-Comparison-no_lnox-fixedBC-using_wrfgridcorners.mat'
