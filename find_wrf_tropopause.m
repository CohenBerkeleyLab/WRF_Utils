function [ tp_lev ] = find_wrf_tropopause( wrf_info, assume_top )
%FIND_WRF_TROPOPAUSE Find the model level where the tropopause is
%   The WRF preprocessor determines the tropopause level in the model as
%   being where the average lapse rate over 3 model layers is < 2 K/km.
%   This replicates that calculation. 
%
%   The only required input is a structure obtained from ncinfo that points
%   to a netCDF file of WRF output that contains the calculated quantities
%   TT (actual temperature), z (altitude calculated from geopotential), and
%   pres (pressure). Both of these will be calculated if you use the
%   "calculated_quantities.nco" script (which you can run using
%   (slurm)run_wrf_output.sh - these quantities will not be in regular WRF
%   output).
%
%   This function works by starting at the top of each vertical profile and
%   moving downwards, looking for the last group of 3 model layers that
%   have an average lapse rate < 2 K/km.  It will stop at z = 3000 m, to
%   avoid accidentally detecting a temperature inversion.  If it reaches
%   the 3000 m cutoff, it will by default assign a value of -1 as the
%   tropopause level, which should be interpreted as indicating that the
%   algorithm failed to find a tropopause.  This behavior can be overridden
%   by passing "true" as the optional second parameter. In this mode, it
%   will check to see if the lapse rate was ever < 2 K/km. If not, it will
%   assume that it did not find a tropopause because all layers in that
%   profile are below it, and so the tropopause level will be set to the
%   top-most index.
