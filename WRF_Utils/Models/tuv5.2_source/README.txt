******************  1.   SELECTING AN INPUT FILE:

Input files are used to modify the conditions for the radiation 
calculations, and to select different desired outputs. Several sample
input files are provided.  They can be modified by the user, saved
(with a different name), and re-called.  The default input files are:

defin1 = suggested for calculations of UV spectral irradiances 
at the Earth's surface. The wavelength range is 280-420 nm in 1 nm steps, 
and the outputs are spectral irradiance and several weighted irradiances:
UV-B (280-315 nm), UV-B*(280-320 nm), UV-A (315-400 nm), DNA damage,
CIE erythema, and the UV-Index. The radiation is calculated with a 
2-stream delta-Eddington code, and values are the sum of the direct sun
and down-welling diffuse radiation (dirsun = difdn = 1, difup = 0).

defin2 = suggested for calculations of spectral actinic fluxes and photolysis
rate coefficients (J-values), at 0.5 km above sea level.  The wavelength 
range is 121-735 nm in 156 non-equally spaced intervals (standard WMO grid).
Wavelengths shorter than ca. 290 nm are important if the output altitude
(zout) is set to the stratosphere or higher. J-values for several different 
reactions are given.  The radiation is calculated with a 4-stream discrete
ordinates code, and values are the sum of all directions: Direct sun, 
down-welling diffuse, and up-welling diffuse (dirsun = difdn = difup = 1).

defin3 = Output for use with the NCAR Master Mechanism. 

defin4 = Illustrates the possible outputs that can be obtained by use of the
logical switches (lirrad, laflux, lmmech, lrates, ljvals all set to .TRUE.) and
by using non-zero values for the integers isfix, ijfix, iwfix, itfix, izfix.
NOTE:  The tables of values (e.g. spectral irradiance vs. altitude and wavelength)
can get quite large, therefore only very coarse resolution is specified for this
illustration of possible outputs.  
CAUTION: The actual values of radiative quantities are not very accurate when
using such low wavelength and altitude resolution.

Sample output, obtained with each of these default input files (defin1-4) can
be found in the subdirectory SAMPLES.

******************  2.  CHANGING THE VALUES

The values of various input and control variables can be changed.  
By typing ?variable, you will get a few lines of help on that variable.
To change a value, type the name of the variable shown in the table. 
(NOTE:  The variable names are case-sensitive)

If the variable requires a number, you will be prompted to enter the new value.

If the variable requires a character string (e.g. a filename), you will be 
prompted to enter the new value.

If the variable is of type LOGICAL, it will switch (toggle) between True and
False.

If the variable is nms, you will be taken to a new menu of available
weighting functions (action spectra).  In the new menu, type the number of the
weighting function to switch  on/off (True/False). Note that multiple
pages are available.

If the variable is mnj, you will be taken to a new menu of available
photolysis reactions. In the new menu, type the number of the
photolysis reaction to switch  on/off (True/False). Note that multiple
pages are available

When done with the changes, press <enter> to continue.

******************  3.  SAVING THE NEW INPUT FILE

You will be asked if you want to save your modifications to the input file.
You can give any name to the new input file (default = usrinp).
Next time you run the program, you can read this input file rather than
starting anew from one of the default inputs.

******************  4.  OUTPUT CONTROL

Output will be written to files in the directory ONE LEVEL ABOVE the
directory containing the executable.  In windows, this means the output
will appear in the directory that contains the file Run_tuv.bat.

You can change the name of the output file by changing the variable name
"outfil" in the main tabular menu.  The default is "usrout"

The program will add the extension .txt to the output name, e.g.
    usrout.txt

You can also send the output to the screen instead of a file, but this
is not recommended if printing large tables.

Output options are enabled by switching (True/False) several variables:
lirrad, laflux, lmmech, lrates, ljvals.

Detailed output tables can also be created by setting non-zero integer values 
for isfix, ijfix, iwfix, itfix, izfix.  These create "slices" through three-
dimensional matrices of results.  For example, the spectral irradiance is
a function of 3 coordinates:  time (t), wavelength (w), and altitude (z).
If you set itfix = 2, the output will have a table of spectral irradiance
as a function of wavelength and altitude, for the 2nd time step.  If you
set iwfix = 10, the output will be the spectral irradiance at the 10th 
wavelength (as set with wstart, wstop, nwint), as a function of altitude and
time.

Sample output files are provided in subdirectory SAMPLE.  The file
SAMPLE/usrout4 shows the various available outputs.

The code will also output a file 'tuvlog.txt' which records the inputs used
in the calculations. If you have probelms with the code, sending this file to
the developers may help identify them.

******************  5.  FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

a)  What is the difference between zstart and zout? 
The variable zstart is the elevation, in km above sea level, of the ground.
If zstart = 0, the surface is at sea level.
On the other hand, zout is the altitude (km, above sea level) for which you want
output.  For example, suppose you are flying in an airplane 500 m above the
ground in Boulder, Colorado.  Boulder is located 1.7 km above sea level, so
zstart = 1.7, while zout = 2.2 (1.7 + 0.5 km).

b)  What is the purpose of zaird, ztemp?
For some photolysis reactions, the absorption cross sections and quantum
yields may depend on temperature and/or pressure.  If the local (at z = zout)
temperature and pressure are known, and if they are different from the
US Standard Atmosphere, they can be put in here.  These values do not affect
the radiation field.

c)  What is the purpose of the variables dirsun, difdn, and difup?
They allow the user to compute separately the direct solar beam component
(dirsun), the diffuse down-welling or scattered radiation (difdn), or the
diffuse up-welling radiation (difup, which includes reflections from the 
surface and, if zout > zstart, from the atmosphere below).  Examples:
- down-welling irradiance or actinic flux:  dirsun = difdn = 1, difup = 0
- total actinic flux: dirsun = difdn = difup = 1
- net irradiance:  dirsun = difdn = 1, difup = -1

e)  Can I calculate the diffuse/direct ratio?
Not in a single calculation.  You must do two calculations:
the first with dirsun = 1, difdn = difup = 0
the second with  dirsun = 0, difdn = 1, difup = 0
Then you can take the ratio of the results.

f)  How can I get the extraterrestrial solar spectral irradiance or 
actinic flux?
Set 
      zout = zstop 
      lzenith = T  
      tstart = 0
      nt = 1
      dirsun = 1
      difdn = 0
      difup = 0
Then for spectral irradiance use
     lirrad = T  (for W m-2 nm-1)
or for actinic flux use:
     laflux = T ( for quanta cm-2 s-1 nm-1)

g) How can I calculate atmospheric transmission down to a particular level?
Calculate the spectral irradiance or spectral actinic flux at desired
altitude (zout), then separately calculate the extraterrestrial spectral
irradiance or actinic flux (see FAQ-f), and finally divide the results.

h) Are the wavelengths defined IN-VACUUM or IN-AIR?
The TUV model works strictly with IN-VACUUM wavelengths.  This includes
all spectral data, such as extraterrestrial spectral irradiance, 
absorption cross sections, quantum yields, and action spectra.
However:  Some users may want spectral irradiances or spectral actinic
fluxes on a wavelength scale defined IN-AIR. In this case, you must edit
the main program (TUV.f) and set the logical variable lrefr=.TRUE.
If lrefr=.TRUE., 
- the specified wavelength grid will be assumed to be IN-AIR
- the calculations will be done IN-VACUUM (the code will shift the grid)
- the results will be reported on the IN-AIR grid (the code will shift back).
The wavelength shift will be calculated with an index of refraction appropriate
for the main output altitude, zout.  Note that the wavelength scale at other
altitudes will not be correct and should not be used.
Control of this option is not available from the interactive input table.
