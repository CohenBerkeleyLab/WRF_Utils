_________________________________________
Version 5.0, November 2010, S. Madronich

Added some data files on O3 column and profile climatology in directory 
DATAE1/ATM.  At this point, the code does not ingest the data but this can
be easily modified, and will be in the future.

Wrote individual read routines for O3 cross section data (WMO1985, Molina and Molina,
JPL2006, Reims group, Bass et al.).  This makes it easier to switch between the different
data sets.

Corrected O3 cross section wavelengths.  Original data is in standard air, 
now converted to vacuum wavelengths for use in TUV which is assumed in vacuum.
Previous versions of TUV did not make this conversion, so there was a slight
misalignment between wavelengths of the O3 cross sections (which were in air)
and the extraterrestrial flux (which was in vac)

Added O3 cross section from Reims group (Malicet et al., Brion et al.)
and also from JPL2006

Added ET flux from Chance and Kurucz (200-1000 nm by 0.01 nm steps)

Removed orphan references to ftrim (in savout.f) and to plkavg (in rtrans.f)

Added ClO photolysis per JPL2006

Corrected error in acetone quantum yield enforcing upper/lower bounds of 1./0.
(most likely inconsequential)  for Blitz qy (thanks to Barron Henderson, U. North Carolina,  for catching this)
      
Updated to JPL2006:
   NO2 absorption and quantum yield
Also moved NO2 absorption read/interpolate data into subroutines for different data sets,
so can call for (1) transmission, and (2) photolysis.

_________________________________________
Version 4.6 March 2009, Sasha Madronich
Corrected indexing problem for PAN and PPN, two channels:
        j = j+1
        jlabel(j) = 'CH3CO(OONO2) -> CH3CO(OO) + NO2'
        j = j+1
        jlabel(j) = 'CH3CO(OONO2) -> CH3CO(O) + NO3'
    The sq assignment was to j and j+1 rather than to j-1 and j.  Therefore the 
    NO2 channel was not assigned (zeros) and the NO3 channel contained the NO2 channel
    instead.  Same problem for PPN.
Deleted old input files in directory INPUTS (mex, j01, t1).  The order of reactions was 
    old and different than new order. Their potential use would lead to mis-assignment of reactions.
Changed interopolation schemes in vpair.  Now interpolating log concentrations onto z-grid, 
    then doing log integration to get column increments.  Also changed notation.
Changed interpolation schemes in vpo3. Linear interpolations of concentrations.  Also extended the 
    ussa O3 profile to 121 km (from 74 km) using exponential scale height of 4.5 km.

Version 4.5 July-September 2007, Sasha Madronich
Added biological weighting functions for:
	vitamin-D production (CIE, 2006a)
	non-melanoma skin cancer spectrum (CIE, 2006b)
Added photolysis reactions: 
	CH3COCH2CH3 (MEK)
	CH3CH2COO2NO2 (PPN) 
	CH2=CHCHO (acrolein)
	CH3CO(OOH) (peracetic acid)
Modified:
	CH2=C(CH3)CHO (methacrolein) updated to JPL2007
	Put in quantum yields for PAN photolysis to NO2 and NO3
Created z-grid for mexico city. Cleaned up some gridz options.
Created option to overwrite PBL pollutants O3, SO2, NO2, aerosol
   This is a preliminary add-on, with some cautions requred. See TUV.f
Changed deltax to 1e-5 (in file params). This uncovered minor data 
   termination error in file rxn.f, subroutine r43, for Halon-2402 (CF2BrCF2Br)
Changed order of photolysis reactions (in swchem.f), to group together 
   related reactions.
Moved all input files (including default inputs, and user-defined inputs) 
   to new directory INPUTS
Regenerated SAMPLE files.  Most values are identical to before.  Some 
   minor changes, mostly due to new/modifed photolysis reaction.

Version 4.3 uses the new acetone (CH3COCH3) quantum yields from:
* 4:  Blitz, M. A., D. E. Heard, M. J. Pilling, S. R. Arnold, and M. P. Chipperfield 
*       (2004), Pressure and temperature-dependent quantum yields for the

This was already implemented in version 4.2 on May 4 2004.  However, earlier versions of tuv4.2 may
use the older data from McKeen et al.

Version 4.3 corrects an error existing in version 4.2.  The error concerns
the option to shift between in-vacuum and in-air wavelengths.  This option 
is enabled by setting the logical variable lrefr=.TRUE. in the driver 
program, TUV.f.  The error was in subroutine wshift.f, and applied the 
shift in the wrong direction.  The correct eqations
(used in version 4.3) are:

      IF(mrefr .EQ. 1) THEN
         DO i = 1, n
            w(i) = w(i) * refrac(w(i),airden)
         ENDDO
      ELSEIF(mrefr .EQ. -1) THEN
         DO i = 1, n
            w(i) = w(i) / refrac(w(i),airden)
         ENDDO
      ENDIF

and replace the incorrect equations (in version 4.2)

      IF(mrefr .EQ. 1) THEN
         DO i = 1, n
            w(i) = w(i) * refrac(w(i),airden)  !! INCORRECT
         ENDDO
      ELSEIF(mrefr .EQ. -1) THEN
         DO i = 1, n
            w(i) = w(i) / refrac(w(i),airden)  !! INCORRECT
         ENDDO
      ENDIF

* Thanks to Joe Michalsky (NOAA) for catching this error.
