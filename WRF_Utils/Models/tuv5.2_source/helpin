The TUV model calculates solar short-wave radiation in the 
Earth's atmosphere.  Available output includes:
-  Spectral irradiance, W m-2 nm-1
-  Spectral actinic flux, quanta cm-2 s-1 nm-1
-  Spectrally integrated irradiance, unweighted or weighted
     by biological action spectra, W m-2
-  Photolysis rate coefficients, s-1
Type ?xxx (where xxx = variable name) for help on inputs, 
e.g. type ?tmzone to get help on entering time zone.
Inputs and outputs can be saved in different files. 
A log file (tuvlog) is also created.
  Only some simple changes are possible in the interactive 
version. Additional changes (e.g. shapes of vertical profiles 
of ozone, clouds, aerosols; wavelength dependent albedo, etc.) 
can be made by obtaining and editing the Fortran source code. 
The full TUV model is available at:
