file CH2O_NBS_MOOR.AVE -  CH2O cross sect. ratio Moortgat to Bass et al (NBS)
At T = 290 K
Moortgat tabulates band max absorption, obtained with 0.5 nm resol.
Bass et al. give values every 0.025 nm.
Therefore before computing ratios, the following was done:
(1) the Bass et al. values were smoothed (running average) over 20 
points (0.5 nm) using the program [MADRONICH.JVALUES]SMOOTH.FOR
(2) band maxima were identified for the smoothed Bass data.
(3) these were compared to the Mortgat values. ratios given below
(4) add end points (450.,1.82) and (250.,1.03)

Wavelengths are those from the Bass data. There is about a 5-10 nm shift
between band maxima of Moortgat and of Bass (Moortgat longer wave)
To estimate the Moortgat values at all wavelengths, use the following band
max ratios to multiply the Bass values.
To estimate an average between Moortgat and Bass, use formula
average cross sect. = (Bass value)*(1. + ratio)/2.
