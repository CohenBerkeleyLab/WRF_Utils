file CH2O_I_MAD.YLD Quantum yields for CH2O->H+HCO, evaluated by S.Madronich
using data from:
Moortgat et al. (1983) J.Chem.Phys. v.78, p.1185-1190.
Horowitz and Calvert (1978) Int.J.Chem.Kin., X, 805.
Also used data given in Horowitz and Calvert, as renormalized by them:
    from Marlin,  from Clark.
Data of Lewis et al. was specifically discarded because appears to be too low
at shorter wavelengths.
