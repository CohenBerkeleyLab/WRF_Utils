CH2O + hv -> H + HCO  (Phi1)
          -> H2 + CO  (Phi2)

"The quantum yields have been reported with good agreement by Horowitz and
Calvert [691], Clark et al. [307], Tang et al. [1535], Moortgat and Warneck
[1127], and Moortgat et al. [1121, 1224].  The recommended values listed in
Table 22 are based on the results of these investigators, as evaluated by S.
Madronich (private communication, 1991).  The quantum yield for the production
of H2 and CO is pressure and temperature dependent for wavelengths longer than
about 330 nm (Morrtgat et al. [1124]).  Table 22 gives the values at
atmospheric pressure and room temperature;  the reader is referred to the
Moortgat et al. publication for information on values at lower pressures and
temperatures."

Note:  The values are averaged for 2.5 nm intervals centered on the indicated
wavelength.
