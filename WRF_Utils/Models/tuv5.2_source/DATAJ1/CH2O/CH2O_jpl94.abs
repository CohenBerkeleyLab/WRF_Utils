CH2O + hv -> H + HCO  (Phi1)
          -> H2 + CO  (Phi2)

"The earlier recommendation for the formaldehyde absorption cross sections was
based on the work carried out by Bass et al. [116] with a resolution of 0.05 nm
at 296 K and 223 K, and by Moortgat et al. [1121, 1124] with a resolution of
0.5 nm in the 210-360 K temperature range.  More recently, Cantrell et al.
[250] measured the cross sections in the 300-360 nm range between 223K and 293
K, and Rogers [1338] measured the cross sections in the 235-365 nm range at 296
K, both groups using Fourier transform spectrometry at a resolution of up to
0.011 nm (1 cm-1).  The agreement between these two reports is very good.  The
recommended values are those given by Cantrell et al. as a function of
temperature;  the reader is referred to the original article to obtain the high
resolution data.  Table 22 lists the low resolution cross sections taken from
that work, which are suitable for atmospheric photodissociation calculations."
