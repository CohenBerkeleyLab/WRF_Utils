N2O + hv -> N2 + O(1D)

"The recommended values are taken from the work of Selwyn et al. [1403], who
measured the temperature dependence of the absorption cross section in the
atmospherically relevant wavelength region.  They have fitted their data with
the expression shown in Table 16;  Table 17 presents the romm temperature data.
Hubrich and Stuhl [712] remeasured the N2O cross sections at 298K and 208K and
Merienne et al [1072] in the range from 220K to 296K.  The results of these two
sets of measurements are in very good agreement with those of Selwyn et al.
The quantum yield for photodissociation is unity and the products are N2 and
O(1D) (Zelikoff and Aschenbrand [1777]; Paraskevopoulos and Cvetanovic [1223];
Preston and Barr [1282]; Simonaitis et al. [1427]).  The yield of N(4s) and
NO(2Pi) is less than 1% (Greenblatt and Ravishankara [596])."
