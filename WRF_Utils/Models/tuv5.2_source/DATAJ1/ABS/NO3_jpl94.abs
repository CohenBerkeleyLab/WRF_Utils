NO3 + hv -> NO + O2 (1)
            NO2 + O (2)

"The absorption cross sections for the nitrate free radical, NO3, have been 
studied by (1) Johnston and Graham [778]; (2) Graham and Johnston [589]; (3)
Mitchell et al. [1096]; (4) Marinelli et al. [1030]; (5) Ravishankara and Wine
[1311]; (6) Cox et al. [365]; (7) Burrows et al. [227]; (8) Ravishankara and
Mauldin [1302]; (9) Sander [1360]; (10) Cantrell et al. [251]; and (11)
Canosa-Mas et al. [246].  The 1st and 4th studies required calculation of the
NO3 concentration by modeling a complex kinetic system.  The other studies are
more direct and the results in terms of intefrated absorption coefficients are
in good agreement.  The recommended value at 298 K and 662 nm, (2.00 +-
0.25)x1E-17 cm^2, is the average of the results of studies (4), (5) and (7)
through (11).  The values in the wavelength range 600-670 nm, shown in Figure 2
and listed in Table 15, were calculated using the spectra measured in studies
(8), (9) and (11), and normalizing the 662 nm value to the above average.  The
spectra obtained in other studies are consulted for a more extended wavelength
range.  The temperature dependence of the 662 nm band has been studied by
Ravishankara and Mauldin [1302], Sander [1360] and Cantrell et al. [251], while
the first two investigators observe the cross section at 662 nm to increase
with decreasing temperature, Cantrell et al. [251] found no measurable
dependence.  The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.

[...]

The spectroscopy of NO3 has been review by Wayne et al. [1688].  The reader is
referred to this work for a more detailed discussion of the cross section and
quantum yield data, and for estimates of the photodissociation rates as a
function of zenith angle."
