CF2BrCF2Br (Halon-2402) + hv -> Products

"The preferred absorption cross sections at 298 K, listed in Table 54, are the
mean of the values reported by Gillotay et al. [571] at 2 nm intervals and
Burkholder et al. [219] at 1 nm intervals over the wavelength range where the
agreement is acceptable, i.e., ca. 70%.  At longer wavelengths, Burkholder et
al. [219] measured larger cross sections than those measured by Gillotay et al.
Molina et al. [1106] have also measured these cross sections and they agree
with the results of Gillotay et al. at longer wavelengths.  The agreement
between the three studies at wavelengths shorter than 250 nm is good.  The
results of Robbins [1331] are in good agreement with the recommended values.

The temperature dependence of the cross sections has been measured by Gillotay
et al. [571] and Burkholder et al. [219].  The agreement between the two
studies is poor at longer wavelengths.  We have not evaluated the temperature
dependence of the cross section and the readres are referred to the
investigators for the information."
