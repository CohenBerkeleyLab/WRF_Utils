CF2Br2 (Halon-1202) + hv -> Products

"The preferred absorption cross sections at 298 K, listed in Table 54, are the
mean of the values reported by Gillotay and Simon [101] at 2 nm intervals and
Burkholder et al. [40] at 1 nm intervals over the wavelength range where the
agreement is no more than a factor of two.  At wavelengths longer than ca. 250
nm, Burkholder et al. [40] measured cross sections larger than those reported
by Gillotay and Simon [101] and Molina et al. [208].  The discrepancy
increases with wavelength and is more than a factor of two beyond 280 nm.
However, the agreement between all three measurements is acceptable below 250
nm.  The values of Molina et al. agree with those of Gillotay and Simon over
the entire range of wavelengths.  The temperature dependence of the cross
sections has been measured by Gillotay and Simon as well as Burkholder et al.
[40].  The agreement between these two studies is poor.  Orkin and Kasimovskaya
[236] measured the cross sections in the wavelength range 190-320 nm at 295 K;
their results agree with the recommended values.

The quantum yield for the dissociation of CF2Br2 has been measured to be unity
at 206, 248 and 308 nm by Molina and Molina [205], independent of pressure, in
contrast to an earlier report by Walton [323] that the quantum yield at 265
decreases from unity when the system pressure is raised to 50 torr of CO2."
