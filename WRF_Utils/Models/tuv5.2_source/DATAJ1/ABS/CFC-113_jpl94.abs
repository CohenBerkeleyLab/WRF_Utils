CF2ClCFCl2 (CFC-113) + hv -> Products

"The recommended absorption cross section values for these species at 295 K and
at 210 K are presented in Table 42, and are taken from Simon et al. [1426].
These values are in good agreement with those reported by Hubrich and Stuhl
[712], who also carried out measurements at lower temperatures.  They are also
in good agreement with the data of Chou et al. [299], except that these authors
report cross section values for CF3CF2Cl that are about 50% higher.  Also, for
this species the temperature dependency is unimportant in the wavelength region
of interest."
