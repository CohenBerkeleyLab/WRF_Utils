CF3Br (Halon-1301) + hv -> Products

"The preferred absorption cross sections at 298K, listed in Table 54, are the
mean of the values reported by Gillotay and Simon [568] at 2 nm intervals and
Burkholder et al. [219] at 1 nm intervals over the wavelength range where the
agreement is acceptable, i.e., better than 70%.  At longer wavelengths 
Burkholder et al. [219] measure larger values than those reported by Gillotay
and Simon.  However, the agreement in the wavelength range 190-230 nm among the
three studies is excellent.  The temperature dependence of the cross sections
has been measured by Gillotay and Simon as well as Burkholder et al. [219].
The agreement between these two studies is poor.  We have not evaluated the
temperature dependedence of the cross sections and the readers are referred to
the original publications for this information.  For all the
bromofluoromethanes, photolysis is expected to cleave the C-Br bond with unit
quantum efficiency."
