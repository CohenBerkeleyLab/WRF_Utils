CF2O + hv -> Products

"The recommended absorption cross sections are listed in Table 43, as averages
over the 500 cm-1 intervals commonly employed for atmospheric modeling (the
wavelength given in the table is the center of the interval).  The values for
CCl2O are based on the work of Gillotay et al. [572], who measured the cross
sections between 170 and 320 nm at temperatures ranging from 210 to 295K;  the
temperature effect is significant only at wavelengths longer than 250 nm.
These cross section values are in good agreement with those recommended
earlier, which were based on the data of Chou et al. [298].  For CClFO the
recommended values are based on this latter work between 184 and 199 nm, and
they are taken from the work of Noelle et al. [1195] at the longer wavelengths.
These workers measured the cross sections at temperatures ranging from 223 to
298 K;  the temperature effect is not important for atmospheric
photodissociation calculations, as is the case with CCl2O.  For CF2O the cross
section values are taken from Molina and Molina [1103] between 184 and 199 nm,
and from Noelle et al. [1196] at the longer wavelengths;  these authors
measured the cross sections at 296K between 200 and 230 nm.

The photodissociation quatnum yield for CCl2O is unity (Calvert and Pitts
[241]);  the spectrum is a continuum.  Similarly, the quantum yield for CClFO
is taken as unity;  the spectrum shows little structue.  In contrast, the CF2O
spectrum is highly structured;  nevertheless, its photodissociation quantum
yield is also taken as unity, as reported by Noelle et al. [1196].  The self
reaction of the CFO photodissociation product regenerates CF2O, and hence the
apparent quantum yield is less than unity."
