From JPL 2002:
CLOOCl + hv -> Cl + ClOO. Recommended absorption cross sections in the wavelength range 190-450 nm for
ClOOCl are listed in Table 4-29. The values for the wavelength range 200-360 nm are the average of
experimental results reported by Cox and Hayman [90], DeMore and Tschuikow-Roux [107], Permien et al.
[313], and Burkholder et al. [53]. For the 190-200-nm range the data are from DeMore and Tschuikow-Roux
[107], these being the only data available in that range. Data at wavelengths greater than 360 nm were obtained
from a linear extrapolation of the logarithm of the cross sections, using the expression
log(10**20 sigma(cm2)) = -0.01915 x lambda(nm) + 7.589. For lambda > 360 nm the extrapolated data are considered to be more
reliable than the experimental measurements because of the very small dimer cross sections in this region.
While the results of Cox and Hayman, DeMore and Tschuikow-Roux, Permien et al., and Burkholder et al. are
in good agreement at wavelengths below 250 nm, there are significant discrepancies at longer wavelengths,
which may be attributed to uncertainties in the spectral subtraction of impurities such as Cl2O, Cl2, and Cl2O2.
Huder and DeMore [167] measured ClOOCl cross sections over the 190-310-nm range using a method that
minimized the corrections required for impurities such as Cl2O. The cross sections from this study are
significantly smaller (up to a factor of 2) than the current recommendation, particularly when extrapolated
beyond 400 nm. Additional measurements are needed, particularly at the longer wavelengths, to check the
results of Huder and DeMore.
These studies also indicate that only one stable species is produced in the recombination reaction of ClO with
itself, and that this species is dichlorine peroxide, ClOOCl, rather than ClOClO. Using submillimeter wave
spectroscopy, Birk et al. [34] have further established the structure of the recombination product to be ClOOCl.
These observations are in agreement with the results of quantum mechanical calculations (McGrath et al.
[254,255]; Jensen and Odershede [184]; Stanton et al. [387]).
