            CHEMICAL KINETICS AND PHOTOCHEMICAL DATA FOR USE IN 
            STRATOSPHERIC MODELING.
            DECEMBER 15, 1994
TEMPERATURE:  NO TEMPERATURE REPORTED BETWEEN 200 AND 280 NM
              TEMPERATURE DEPENDANDENCE BETWEEN 280 AND 380 NM IS
              GIVEN BY THE EXPRESSION:
    
    FOR 285 NM < WAVELENGTH < 380 NM
    300 K > T > 225 K

    10EXP20*XS = EXP[2.735 + ((4728.5 - 17.127*W)/T]
    
    WHERE XS/CM SQ ;  W/NM;  T/K

ABSORPTION CROSS SECTION DATA REPORTED BY YAO ET AL. (1982)
TEMPERATURE RANGE FROM 223 TO 300 K
