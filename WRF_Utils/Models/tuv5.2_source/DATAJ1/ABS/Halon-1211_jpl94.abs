CF2BrCl (Halon-1211) + hv -> Products

"The preferred absorption cross sections at 298 K, listed in Table 54, are the
mean of the values reported by Gillotay and Simon [568] at 2 nm intervals and
Burkholder et al. [219] at 1 nm intervals.  Molina et al. [1106] and Giolando
et al. [574] have also measured the cross sections at 5 nm and 10 nm intervals,
respectively.  The agreement between the four studies is quite good.

The temperature dependence of the cross sections has been measured by Gillotay
and Sim,on as well as Burkholder et al. [219].  The agreement between the two
studies is poor.  We have not evaluated the temperature dependence of the cross
section and the readers are referred to the original publications for this
information."
