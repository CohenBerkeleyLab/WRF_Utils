CF2ClCF2CHFCl (HCFC-225cb) + hv -> Products

"Table 48 lists the absorption cross sections for these molecules at 298K,
taken from the work of Braun et al. [180].  These values have been fitted with
a mathematical expression for the wavelength range from 170 to 250 nm, for each
of the two molecules;  the expressions are listed in the original publication.
The authors also measured the cross sections in the liquid phase."
