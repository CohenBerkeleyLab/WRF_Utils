BrO -> Br + O. The BrO radical has a banded spectrum in the 290Â¨C380 nm range. 
The strongest absorption feature is around 338 nm. The measured cross sections 
are both temperature- and resolution dependent. As an example, the spectrum 
measured by Wahner et al. [423] is shown in Figure 4-4. The bands are due to a 
vibrational progression in the A <- X system, and the location of the bands, 
along with the assignments and cross sections measured using 0.4 nm resolution, 
are shown in Table 4-62. BrO is expected to dissociate upon light absorption. 
As a guide, the cross sections averaged over 5 nm wavelength intervals are taken 
from the work of Cox et al. [92], and are listed in Table 4-63. These authors 
estimate a BrO lifetime against atmospheric photodissociation of ~20 seconds at 
the earth's surface, for a solar zenith angle of 30 deg. The earlier BrO cross 
section measurements were carried out mostly around 338 nm, and these have been
reviewed by CODATA ([81,82]).
