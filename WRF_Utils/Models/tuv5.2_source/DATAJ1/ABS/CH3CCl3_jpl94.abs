CH3CCl3 + hv -> Products

"The absorption cross sections have been measured by Robbuns [1331],
Vanlaethem-Meuree et al. [1615], Hubrich and Stuhl [712], and Nayak et al.
[1148].  Hubrich and Stuhl corrected the results to account for the presence of
a UV-absorbing stabilizer in their samples, a correction which might account
for the rather large discrepancy with the other three sets of measurements,
which are in good agreement with each other.  The recommended values are taken
from Vanlaethem-Meuree et al. [1615], who report values at 210 K, 230 K, 250 K,
270 K and 295 K, every 2 nm, and in a separate table at wavelengths
corresponding to the wavenumber intervals generally used in stratospheric
photodissociation calculations.  Table 45 lists the values at 210 K, 250 K and
295 K, every 5 nm;  the odd wavelength values were computed by linear
interpolation.  These values agree within 10% with those reported by Nayak et
al.;  these authors carried out measurements between 160 and 260 nm, from 220
to 330 K."
