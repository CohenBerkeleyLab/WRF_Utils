"The preferred absorption cross sections at 298 K, listed in Table 47, are the 
mean of the values reported by Gillotay and Simon [570] and Orlando et al.
[1212] over the wavelength range where the agreement is bettern than a factor
of two.  At lower wavelengths the agreement is much better;  e.g., at 200 nm
the agreement is within 5%.  Green and Wayne [594] and Hubrich and Stuhl [712]
have also measured the cross sections in the ranges 185-200 nm and 160-230 nm,
respectively.  The results of Green and Wayne are very different from the
recommended value and were not considered for this evaluation.  The results of
Hubrich and Stuhl (reported at 5 nm intervals) are in reasonable agreement
with the more recent studies of Fillotay and Simon and of Orlando et al.  The
temperature dependence of the cross sections has been measured by Orlando et
al. and by Gillotay and Simon;  it has not been included in this evaluation."
