CH3Cl + hv -> Products

"The preferred absorption cross sections, listed in Table 44, are those given
by Vanlaethem-Meuree er al [1614].  These values are in very good agreement
with those reported by Robbins [1330] at 298 K, as well as with those given by
Hubrich et al. [713] at 298 K and 208 K, if the temperature trend is taken into
consideration.  The results recently reported by Simon et al. [1425] over the
temperature range 295-210K are in excellent agreement with the present
recommendation."
