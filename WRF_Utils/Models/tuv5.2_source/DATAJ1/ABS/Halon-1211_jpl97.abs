CF2ClBr (Halon-1211) + hv -> Products

"The preferred absorption cross sections at 298 K, listed in Table 59, are the
mean of the values reported by Gillotay and Simon [201] at 2 nm intervals and
Burkholder et al. [40] at 1 nm intervals.  Molina et al. [208], Giolando
et al. [106], and Orkin and Kasimovskaya have also measured the cross sections 
at 5 nm and 10 nm intervals, respectively.  The agreement among all these 
studies is quite good.

The temperature dependence of the cross sections has been measured by Gillotay
and Simon as well as Burkholder et al.  The agreement between the two
studies is poor.  We have not evaluated the temperature dependence of the cross
section and the readers are referred to the original publications for this
information.  Orkin and Kasimovskaya measured the cross ssections in the
wavelength range 190-320 nm, at 295 K; their results agree with the
recommendation."
