CCl3F (CFC-11) + hv -> Products

"Tables 39, 40 and 41 list the present recommendations for the cross sections
of CCl4, CCl3F and CCl2F2, respectively.  These data are given by the mean of
the values reported by various groups, i.e., Hubrich et al. [713], Hubrich and
Stuhl [712], Vanlaethem-Meuree et al. [1613, 1614], and Green and Wayne [594],
as well as those referred to in earlier evaluations (CODATA [347]).  Absorption
cross sections for these species over the temperature range 295-210K have also
been reported by Simon et al. [1425].  These results are in generally good
agreement with the present recommendations.  Expressions for the temperature
dependence of the CCl3F and CCl2F2 cross sections are given at the bottom of
Tables 40 and 41, respetively.  These expressions are valid in the wavelength
range of maximum solar photodissociation, i.e., about 190-210 nm, but may not
exactly reproduce the experimental temperature dependences outside this
wavelength range.  However, J-value calculations should not be affected."

sigma(T) = sigma(298) * exp[1E-04 (lambda-184.9)(T-298)]
where sigma(298) = cross section at 298 K
