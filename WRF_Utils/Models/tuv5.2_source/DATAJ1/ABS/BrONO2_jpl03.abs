BrONO2 -> Products. 
The bromine nitrate cross sections have been measured at room temperature by
Spencer and Rowland [386] in the wavelength region 186-390 nm, and by 
Burkholder et al. [54] from 200-500 nm. The results from both studies are in 
excellent agreement over the range of spectral overlap. The recommended cross 
sections (Table 4-65) are taken from Burkholder et al. The only study of 
photolysis products is that of Nickolaisen and Sander [292]. In that study, 
quantum yields for the Br + NO3 and BrO + NO2 channels were measured using 
broadband photolysis in quartz (lambda>200 nm) and pyrex (lambda>300 nm) 
reaction cells with the assumption that these were the only reaction pathways. 
The quantum yields were phi(BrO+NO2) = 0.71 and phi(Br+NO3) = 0.29.
