# A linear regression through the data above (for phi(O(3P))) gives the
# following approximation for phi(O(3P)):
#
#         phi(O(3P)) = 3.832441 - 0.012809638 * lambda
#
# Assuming the cutoff points at phi = 1 and phi = 0, we get the following:
#      
#    phi(O(3P)) = 1                           for l < 221.11820
#    phi(O(3P)) = 3.832441 - 0.012809638 * l  for 221.11820 <= l <= 299.18441
#    phi(O(3P)) = 0                           for l > 299.18441
