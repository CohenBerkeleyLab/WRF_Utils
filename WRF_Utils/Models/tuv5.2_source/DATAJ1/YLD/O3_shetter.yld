O3 + hv -> O2 + O(1D)

"The measurements have been compared to modeled photolysis rate coefficients
calculated using quantum yields from DeMore et al. [1994], from Michelsen et
al. [1994], and from a reevaluation of the existing data.  Indications from the
comparison of many days of clear sky data are that quantum yields in the
312-320 nm range are not close to zero as suggested by DeMore et al. [1994] but
closer to the data of Brock and Watson [1980] and Armerding et al. [1995], thus
agreeing with the conclusions of Muller et al. [1995].  A recommendation for
the quantum yield as a function of wavelength and temperature is made from our
reevaluation of the existing data and fits well with the data taken at MLOPEX
II."

"At present, to obtain data at temperatures other than room temperature, the
expressions of Adler-Golden and Michelsen are used (after multiplication by
0.95) to give Phi versus wavelength data at 230 K, and interpolations between
230 and 298 K are conducted using the following expression:

     Phi(lambda,T) = A(lambda) Exp[ -B(lambda)/T ]             (11)

Table 1 lists the recommended O(1D) quantum yields at 298 K and 230 K
normalized to 0.95 at 305 nm and the A and B factors for extrapolating the data
to other temperatures using the above equation."

"Table 1:  Recommended ozone photolysis O(1D) quantum yileds at 298 K and 230 K
normalized to 0.95 at 305 nm and the A and B factors for extrapolating the data
to other temperatures using Equation 11."

[Comment:  Table 1 has been extended by 'artificial' values of A and B from
280-306 nm to generalize the applicability of Phi=A*EXP(-B/T).  Also, the
recommended value at 260 nm has been included in the table.  ***SF**]
